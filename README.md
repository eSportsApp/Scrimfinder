## Why isn't it open source?
We don't want to make the code opensource to reduce bugabusing.

## How can I contribute?
If you have a feature you would love to see in the Bot or found a bug you can open an Issue.
When you already coded the feature you want to see in the Bot feel free creating an pull request.
